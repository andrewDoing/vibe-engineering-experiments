# Chess AI Web App

## 1. Product Overview
- **Core value proposition:**
  - A web-based chess platform where users can play against a variety of built-in AIs (including LLM-based and traditional Python AIs), with the ability to swap AIs at runtime and watch AI vs AI matches.
- **Target audience:**
  - Chess enthusiasts, AI/ML hobbyists, and developers interested in chess AI performance and behavior.

## 2. Functional Specifications
2.1 Users can play chess against a built-in AI (Python or LLM-based).
2.2 Users can watch AI vs AI matches by selecting two AIs to play against each other.
2.3 Users can swap the AI opponent at any time during a game.
2.4 The chessboard is a simple, interactive 2D UI.
2.5 The app persists games, allowing users to resume or review previous games.
2.6 The app provides a selection of built-in AIs (no user uploads).
2.7 The app validates all moves and handles AI errors or timeouts gracefully.

## 3. Technical Specifications
- **Frontend:** React (or similar) for the 2D chessboard and UI.
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) to manage game state, AI engines, and persistence.
- **AI Plugin System:** Built-in Python modules and LLM API integrations, selectable at runtime.
- **Chess Logic:** Use `python-chess` for move validation and board state management.
- **Persistence:** Store games in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite or Postgres).
- **Security:** No user-uploaded code; only trusted, built-in AIs.
- **Deployment:** Dockerized for easy local and cloud deployment.

## 4. MVP Scope
- 2D chessboard UI with move input and highlighting.
- Playable human vs AI and AI vs AI modes.
- Runtime AI swapping (from a set of built-in AIs).
- Game persistence (save/load games).
- At least two built-in AIs: one simple Python AI, one LLM-based AI.
- Basic error handling for AI failures/timeouts.

## 5. Business Model
- **Key differentiators:**
  - Runtime AI swapping, AI vs AI mode, and LLM-based AI integration.
- **Potential business model:**
  - Free MVP; future options include premium AI engines, cloud LLM access, or analytics features.

## 6. Marketing Plan
- **Target audience:**
  - Chess players, AI/ML enthusiasts, and developers.
- **Overall marketing strategy:**
  - Highlight unique features (runtime AI swapping, AI vs AI, LLM integration) on social media and developer forums.
- **Marketing channels:**
  - Reddit (r/chess, r/MachineLearning), Twitter/X, Hacker News, and AI/ML Discord communities.
